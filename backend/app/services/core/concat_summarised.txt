During the week concluding on November 9, prices for LCO (Lithium Cobalt Oxide) witnessed a decline, influenced by a decrease in the costs of its primary raw materials, tricobalt tetraoxide (Co3O4) and lithium carbonate. Although there was an anticipation of reduced shipments, the start of November saw an unexpected increase in orders for LCO cathode producers. This uptick in demand is believed to be driven by intensified mobile digital promotions and the launch of new products, leading to downstream retailers bulking up their inventories and stepping up production to satisfy consumer demand. Despite this, by the end of November, the surge in demand is expected to subside, with cathode manufacturers maintaining a pessimistic view for the LCO market as December approaches.In the week ending November 9, the market for nickel sulphate experienced a significant price decline due to weak fundamentals and reduced support from production costs. Production scheduling for precursors was decreased in November, and there was an ample supply of raw materials, which led to market participants adopting a wait-and-see stance. Moreover, the supply strain for Mixed Hydroxide Precipitate (MHP) eased, causing a downward trend in its discount coefficient. Consequently, as nickel prices fell, the resolve of salt plants to maintain their prices waned. The expectation for the nickel sulphate market for the week ending November 17 was for prices to stabilize within a range of 30,500-31,000 yuan per metric ton (mt).As of November 9, prices of standard 553# silicon metal in East China were down 150 yuan/mt or 1% WoW at 14,200-14,300 yuan/mt. This week witnessed inquiries from polysilicon producers, limited demand from grinding plants, and rigid demand from silicon and aluminium alloy producers. On Monday, some production capacity in Dehong Prefecture, Yunnan Province, was subject to power cuts in turn. Having little impact on silicon buyers. With few inquiries, silicon suppliers had to lower prices.

There was a huge difference in electricity prices between the south and the north during the normal-water period and dry season. Most silicon plants in north China were profitable based on current silicon price, while silicon plants in Yunnan and Sichuan struggled with near the cost line. Silicon production decreased slightly in November, and may further shrink in December amid another rise in electricity prices. Given picture of supply, demand and inventory, short-term silicon market is expected to move sideways.In 2023, the alumina market experienced the successful deployment of new production capacity, with projections indicating that approximately 6.6 million metric tons (mt) of capacity will be operational by 2024. Throughout 2023, a tight equilibrium between supply and demand was maintained due to the gradual addition of new capacity combined with the phasing out of older ones. However, there is a growing concern that this balance might shift towards overcapacity in the following year, suggesting potential challenges for the industry in managing this surplus.The German economy faces increasing concerns of a potential technical recession by the end of 2023, especially within its industry-heavy sectors, following a disappointing release of industrial production data for September. This data marks the fifth consecutive month of decline, with industrial production falling by 1.4% from the previous month and by 3.7% year-on-year across all major sectors. Particularly alarming is the drop in aluminium production reported during the third quarter, with a near 50% decrease in primary aluminium production and a significant decline in semi-finished aluminium products. Moreover, despite being over three years since the onset of the Covid pandemic, industrial production is still 7% below pre-pandemic levels.

The outlook for the end of the year remains bleak, with leading economic indicators for October suggesting a continued downturn with no signs of an imminent recovery. Survey-based assessments and production expectations have weakened, inventories remain high, and a drop in industrial orders for September further clouds the economic forecast. To exit negative trends in industrial production by the fourth quarter, a month-on-month increase of at least 2% is necessary. Unfortunately, without concrete data for the fourth quarter, there is a growing risk that the German economy may indeed enter a recession by the year's end.The Cornerstone Plan 2.0 is a strategic initiative in China's steel industry, aiming to adapt iron resources to the low-carbon transformation trend in steel production. The original plan, launched in 2022, targeted altering the composition of iron resource sources, with set objectives for domestic iron ore concentrate output, steel scrap consumption, and production from Chinese-owned overseas mines by 2025. However, due to challenges in domestic mining and the depletion of resources, these targets were reassessed in version 2.0. This new version, announced at the Green Low Carbon Technology Exchange Conference in June 2023, shifts the focus from quantity to the types and forms of iron resources, including standards for direct reduced iron (DRI) and steel scrap, to facilitate low carbon emission steel production.

The plan outlines the increased importance of pellet usage in blast furnaces and the production of DRI. The growing demand for pellets in China due to decarbonization efforts is supported by the capacity expansion of advanced pellet production facilities and larger blast furnaces, requiring higher pellet ratios. Meanwhile, DRI is emerging as a significant method for steel mills to lower carbon emissions, shown by initiatives like HBIS Group's 600,000-mt DRI facility. Despite these efforts, challenges persist, such as limited domestic concentrate supply, varying ore qualities, and the financial feasibility of producing DRI powder. Going forward, the strategy involves not just mining deeper but improving mining techniques, targeting process enhancements to maximize the value of domestic mineral resources, and deciding the forms of iron resources to produce based on multiple factors such as resource state, company costs, consumer premiums, and mining profits.In 2023, China’s aluminum plate, sheet, and strip production, including aluminum foil stock, is expected to reach approximately 12.3 million metric tons (mt), representing a decrease of about 600,000 mt year-over-year. Aluminum foil production alone is forecasted to be around 4.5 million mt, which is down by roughly 250,000 mt. As a result, the overall production of aluminum plate, sheet, strip, and foil is anticipated to experience negative growth for the year. Despite positive growth in a few products, they are unable to compensate for the drop in demand arising from the global economic slowdown.

Production of specific aluminum products such as can body stock and can lid stock has seen a significant decline, with outputs of 1.6 million mt and 460,000 mt respectively. However, sectors like new energy—which boost the demand for brazing materials and battery aluminum foil—have seen substantial growth. Additionally, high performance in domestic real estate and periods of global hot weather are expected to potentially increase air conditioning aluminum foil production to 1.04 million mt. The key trend for the aluminum plate, sheet, and foil market in 2023 is defined by a lack of orders, intense competition, and producers cutting back on production to maintain profitability, leading generally to lower production projections compared to 2022 and early forecasts for 2023.From January to October 2023, the aluminum industry in China experienced a decline in the average full cost of aluminum by 8.1% year-over-year (YoY), with costs averaging at approximately 16,536 yuan per metric ton (mt). Despite the reduction in costs, the average profit in the sector saw a year-over-year rise of 9%, reaching about 2,110 yuan/mt. In September 2023, due to a combination of factors such as rebounding domestic alumina prices, stable power costs, and a slight uptick in coal prices for certain captive power plants, the full cost of aluminum marginally increased by 0.51% to 15,640 yuan/mt.

During the same period, the average spot price of aluminum stood at around 19,538 yuan/mt. This pricing dynamic resulted in an average industry profit of approximately 3,898 yuan/mt for the month of September, marking a significant monthly increase of 26% and a massive 268% rise on a year-over-year basis.
