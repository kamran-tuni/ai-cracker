From January to October 2023, the aluminum industry in China experienced a decline in the average full cost of aluminum by 8.1% year-over-year (YoY), with costs averaging at approximately 16,536 yuan per metric ton (mt). Despite the reduction in costs, the average profit in the sector saw a year-over-year rise of 9%, reaching about 2,110 yuan/mt. In September 2023, due to a combination of factors such as rebounding domestic alumina prices, stable power costs, and a slight uptick in coal prices for certain captive power plants, the full cost of aluminum marginally increased by 0.51% to 15,640 yuan/mt.

During the same period, the average spot price of aluminum stood at around 19,538 yuan/mt. This pricing dynamic resulted in an average industry profit of approximately 3,898 yuan/mt for the month of September, marking a significant monthly increase of 26% and a massive 268% rise on a year-over-year basis.
