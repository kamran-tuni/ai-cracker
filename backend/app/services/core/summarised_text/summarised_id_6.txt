In 2023, the alumina market experienced the successful deployment of new production capacity, with projections indicating that approximately 6.6 million metric tons (mt) of capacity will be operational by 2024. Throughout 2023, a tight equilibrium between supply and demand was maintained due to the gradual addition of new capacity combined with the phasing out of older ones. However, there is a growing concern that this balance might shift towards overcapacity in the following year, suggesting potential challenges for the industry in managing this surplus.
