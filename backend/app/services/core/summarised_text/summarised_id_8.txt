The Cornerstone Plan 2.0 is a strategic initiative in China's steel industry, aiming to adapt iron resources to the low-carbon transformation trend in steel production. The original plan, launched in 2022, targeted altering the composition of iron resource sources, with set objectives for domestic iron ore concentrate output, steel scrap consumption, and production from Chinese-owned overseas mines by 2025. However, due to challenges in domestic mining and the depletion of resources, these targets were reassessed in version 2.0. This new version, announced at the Green Low Carbon Technology Exchange Conference in June 2023, shifts the focus from quantity to the types and forms of iron resources, including standards for direct reduced iron (DRI) and steel scrap, to facilitate low carbon emission steel production.

The plan outlines the increased importance of pellet usage in blast furnaces and the production of DRI. The growing demand for pellets in China due to decarbonization efforts is supported by the capacity expansion of advanced pellet production facilities and larger blast furnaces, requiring higher pellet ratios. Meanwhile, DRI is emerging as a significant method for steel mills to lower carbon emissions, shown by initiatives like HBIS Group's 600,000-mt DRI facility. Despite these efforts, challenges persist, such as limited domestic concentrate supply, varying ore qualities, and the financial feasibility of producing DRI powder. Going forward, the strategy involves not just mining deeper but improving mining techniques, targeting process enhancements to maximize the value of domestic mineral resources, and deciding the forms of iron resources to produce based on multiple factors such as resource state, company costs, consumer premiums, and mining profits.
