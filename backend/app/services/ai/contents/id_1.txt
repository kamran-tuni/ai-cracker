During the week ending on November 9, LCO prices fell, due to a drop in the costs of tricobalt tetraoxide (Co3O4) and lithium carbonate, its main raw materials. Despite expectations of reduced shipments, LCO cathode producers noted a rise in new orders at the start of November, possibly due to a surge in mobile digital promotions and new product releases, which have spurred sales. As a result, downstream retailers have expanded their stocks of mobile accessory products and increased production to meet consumer demand. However, this boost is forecasted to wane by the end of November, with cathode manufacturers holding a gloomy outlook for the LCO market in December.
