In the week ending November 9, the price of nickel sulphate plunged. This decline was due to a simultaneous weakening of fundamentals and cost-side supports. The scheduled production for precursor in November decreased and there was no significant shortage in raw materials, leading to a prevalent wait-and-see approach. On the cost front, the previously tight supply of MHP has relaxed, and the discount coefficient for MHP has been trending downward. The fall in nickel prices has also diminished the determination of salt plants to maintain their prices. Currently, nickel sulphate's market performance is weak, and prices are expected to find stability in the week ending November 17, within the range of 30,500-31,000 yuan/mt.
