The document discusses the status of alumina production capacity as of 2023, revealing that new production capabilities were successfully introduced during the year. It is optimistically projected that by 2024, there will be around 6.6 million metric tons (mt) of alumina capacity operational. Furthermore, the text mentions that in 2023, the supply and demand for alumina were in tight equilibrium. This was the result of introducing new capacities alongside the phasing out of older ones. However, there is an anticipation of a shift towards overcapacity in the alumina market by 2024.In 2023, China’s aluminum plate, sheet, and strip production, including aluminum foil stock, is expected to reach approximately 12.3 million metric tons (mt), representing a decrease of about 600,000 mt year-over-year. Aluminum foil production alone is forecasted to be around 4.5 million mt, which is down by roughly 250,000 mt. As a result, the overall production of aluminum plate, sheet, strip, and foil is anticipated to experience negative growth for the year. Despite positive growth in a few products, they are unable to compensate for the drop in demand arising from the global economic slowdown.

Production of specific aluminum products such as can body stock and can lid stock has seen a significant decline, with outputs of 1.6 million mt and 460,000 mt respectively. However, sectors like new energy—which boost the demand for brazing materials and battery aluminum foil—have seen substantial growth. Additionally, high performance in domestic real estate and periods of global hot weather are expected to potentially increase air conditioning aluminum foil production to 1.04 million mt. The key trend for the aluminum plate, sheet, and foil market in 2023 is defined by a lack of orders, intense competition, and producers cutting back on production to maintain profitability, leading generally to lower production projections compared to 2022 and early forecasts for 2023.From January to October 2023, the aluminum industry in China experienced a decline in the average full cost of aluminum by 8.1% year-over-year (YoY), with costs averaging at approximately 16,536 yuan per metric ton (mt). Despite the reduction in costs, the average profit in the sector saw a year-over-year rise of 9%, reaching about 2,110 yuan/mt. In September 2023, due to a combination of factors such as rebounding domestic alumina prices, stable power costs, and a slight uptick in coal prices for certain captive power plants, the full cost of aluminum marginally increased by 0.51% to 15,640 yuan/mt.

During the same period, the average spot price of aluminum stood at around 19,538 yuan/mt. This pricing dynamic resulted in an average industry profit of approximately 3,898 yuan/mt for the month of September, marking a significant monthly increase of 26% and a massive 268% rise on a year-over-year basis.
