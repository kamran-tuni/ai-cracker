In 2023, China’s aluminum plate, sheet, and strip production, including aluminum foil stock, is expected to reach approximately 12.3 million metric tons (mt), representing a decrease of about 600,000 mt year-over-year. Aluminum foil production alone is forecasted to be around 4.5 million mt, which is down by roughly 250,000 mt. As a result, the overall production of aluminum plate, sheet, strip, and foil is anticipated to experience negative growth for the year. Despite positive growth in a few products, they are unable to compensate for the drop in demand arising from the global economic slowdown.

Production of specific aluminum products such as can body stock and can lid stock has seen a significant decline, with outputs of 1.6 million mt and 460,000 mt respectively. However, sectors like new energy—which boost the demand for brazing materials and battery aluminum foil—have seen substantial growth. Additionally, high performance in domestic real estate and periods of global hot weather are expected to potentially increase air conditioning aluminum foil production to 1.04 million mt. The key trend for the aluminum plate, sheet, and foil market in 2023 is defined by a lack of orders, intense competition, and producers cutting back on production to maintain profitability, leading generally to lower production projections compared to 2022 and early forecasts for 2023.
